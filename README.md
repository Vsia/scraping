# Web scraping


I used BeautifulSoup for web scraping tool to find the [top 100 Christmas movies](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000096828/
) from The Internet Movie Database (IMDb).
Save the results as .csv file.

Inside the file should include movie rank, movie name, year of release, and IMDB rating four columns.
