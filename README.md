# Web scraping


I used BeautifulSoup with Python on Jupyper Notebook  for web scraping  to find the [top 100 Christmas movies](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000096828/
) from The Internet Movie Database (IMDb).

The results were saved as a .csv file.The  file includes movie rank, movie name, year of release, and IMDB rating four columns.
